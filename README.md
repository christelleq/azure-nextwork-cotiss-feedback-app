## Reviews generated with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
I gave ChatGPT an instruction along with 12 paragraphs of information about Cotiss, taken from their website. My instructions included a description of the reviewer. For example, for a Karen, ChatGPT generated the review:
>As a Karen, I must say that I am extremely disappointed in Cotiss. The platform is not user-friendly at all and I had a lot of difficulty navigating it. The customisation options were limited and didn't meet my needs. I also found the focus on sustainability and supporting diverse businesses to be off-putting. I prefer to stick with the traditional procurement methods and will not be using Cotiss again.
